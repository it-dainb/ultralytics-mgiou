# IMPORTANT: Using Local Modified Loss.py

## Issue with System Installation

The error you encountered shows the code is running from:
```
/usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/ultralytics/utils/loss.py
```

This is the **system-installed** version of Ultralytics, which **does not** contain our NaN fixes.

## Solution: Two Options

### Option 1: Install in Development Mode (Recommended)

Install the local package in editable/development mode so Python uses your local modified files:

```bash
cd /home/dainb_1@digi-texx.local/PROJECTS_locals/ultralytics-mgiou

# Uninstall system package
pip uninstall ultralytics -y

# Install local package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

This will make Python use your local `ultralytics/utils/loss.py` with all the NaN fixes.

### Option 2: Copy Modified File to System Location

**Warning**: This is not recommended as it will be overwritten on package updates.

```bash
# Backup original
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/ultralytics/utils/loss.py /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/ultralytics/utils/loss.py.backup

# Copy modified file
sudo cp /home/dainb_1@digi-texx.local/PROJECTS_locals/ultralytics-mgiou/ultralytics/utils/loss.py /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages/ultralytics/utils/loss.py
```

## Verification

After installing in development mode, verify it's using the correct file:

```python
import ultralytics.utils.loss as loss_module
print(loss_module.__file__)
# Should show: /home/dainb_1@digi-texx.local/PROJECTS_locals/ultralytics-mgiou/ultralytics/utils/loss.py
```

## Then Run Training

```bash
export ULTRALYTICS_DEBUG_NAN=1
python train.py
```

The NaN should now be resolved with the safety mechanisms in place.
