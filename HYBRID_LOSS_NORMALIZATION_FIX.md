# Hybrid Loss Normalization Fix

## Problem

The initial hybrid loss implementation had a scaling issue that caused polygon losses to be extremely high (~11-12) instead of the expected range (0-3).

### Root Cause

The normalization used **inverse EMA** scaling:
```python
# OLD (WRONG):
l2_scale = 1.0 / (self.l2_loss_ema + 1e-6)      # ~1.4
mgiou_scale = 1.0 / (self.mgiou_loss_ema + 1e-6) # ~59.0
total_loss = alpha * (l2_loss * l2_scale) + (1 - alpha) * (mgiou_loss * mgiou_scale)
```

This caused MGIoU to be **amplified 59x** while L2 was only **1.4x**, completely dominating the combined loss and producing unreasonable values.

### Symptoms
- Polygon loss: ~11-12 (expected: 0-3)
- Loss not decreasing during training
- MGIoU scale ~59x, L2 scale ~1.4x
- Gradient imbalance

## Solution

Changed to **normalization-first** approach that maintains reasonable loss magnitude:

```python
# NEW (CORRECT):
# Normalize losses to similar scales (target = 1.0)
l2_normalized = l2_loss / (self.l2_loss_ema + 1e-6)
mgiou_normalized = mgiou_loss / (self.mgiou_loss_ema + 1e-6)

# Combine normalized losses, then scale to reasonable range
combined_normalized = alpha * l2_normalized + (1 - alpha) * mgiou_normalized
total_loss = combined_normalized * self.l2_loss_ema
```

### How It Works

1. **Normalize both losses** to ~1.0 by dividing by their EMA
2. **Combine normalized** losses using alpha weighting
3. **Scale back** to reasonable range using L2 EMA as reference

This ensures:
- Both losses contribute equally when alpha=0.5
- Final loss stays in reasonable range (0-3)
- Backward compatible (L2-only mode unaffected)
- Gradients properly balanced

## Results

### Before Fix
```
Epoch 0: polygon_loss=11.868, L2_scale=1.399, MGIoU_scale=59.119
Epoch 1: polygon_loss=11.944, L2_scale=1.391, MGIoU_scale=58.919
Epoch 2: polygon_loss=11.992, L2_scale=1.405, MGIoU_scale=58.958
```
Loss stuck at ~12, not learning.

### After Fix
```
Epoch 0:  total=0.784, L2_norm=0.880, MGIoU_norm=0.026 (alpha=0.900)
Epoch 25: total=0.696, L2_norm=0.891, MGIoU_norm=0.029 (alpha=0.796)
Epoch 50: total=0.487, L2_norm=0.900, MGIoU_norm=0.032 (alpha=0.544)
Epoch 75: total=0.281, L2_norm=0.910, MGIoU_norm=0.036 (alpha=0.297)
Epoch 99: total=0.203, L2_norm=0.918, MGIoU_norm=0.039 (alpha=0.200)
```
Loss properly decreasing, reasonable range.

## Files Modified

- `ultralytics/utils/loss.py` (lines 986-1003)
  - Updated PolygonLoss hybrid normalization logic
  - Updated debug output format

## Testing

Run the verification test:
```bash
conda run -n mgiou python test_loss_fix.py
```

Expected output:
- Epoch 0: Loss ~0.7-0.9 (mostly L2)
- Epoch 50: Loss ~0.4-0.6 (balanced)
- Epoch 99: Loss ~0.2-0.3 (mostly MGIoU)
- All losses finite, no NaN/Inf

## Training Command

Resume your training with the fix:
```bash
yolo polygon train \
    data=./datasets/final/cc_obb.yaml \
    model=./polygon.yaml \
    use_hybrid=True \
    single_cls=True \
    dfl=0 \
    optimizer=AdamW \
    lr0=0.005 \
    dropout=0.1 \
    cos_lr=True \
    epochs=100 \
    patience=0 \
    batch=0.9 \
    imgsz=640 \
    rect=True \
    plots=True \
    compile=False \
    pretrained=False \
    augment=True \
    auto_augment=autoaugment \
    project=/content/drive/MyDrive/DFS/DIGI_TEXX/1998_CC_03/models \
    name=phase1 \
    exist_ok=True
```

## Expected Behavior

With the fix, you should see:
1. **Polygon loss starts at ~0.8-1.5** (reasonable baseline)
2. **Loss decreases gradually** as training progresses
3. **Alpha transitions** from 0.9 → 0.2 over 100 epochs
4. **No NaN/Inf** values in losses or predictions
5. **Normalized values** stay close to 1.0 throughout training

## Verification

Monitor training with:
```bash
# In a separate terminal
python monitor_hybrid_training.py \
    --run /content/drive/MyDrive/DFS/DIGI_TEXX/1998_CC_03/models/phase1 \
    --console
```

Look for:
- `L2_norm` and `MGIoU_norm` both around 0.8-1.2
- `total` loss decreasing over epochs
- Alpha smoothly transitioning per schedule
