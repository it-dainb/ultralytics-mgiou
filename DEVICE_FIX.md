# Device Mismatch Fix for MGIoUPoly EMA Buffers

## Summary
Fixed RuntimeError caused by device mismatch between registered buffers (`_mgiou_ema`, `_prev_pow`) and input tensors during CUDA training.

## Error
```
RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu!
```

**Location:** `ultralytics/utils/loss.py:501` in `MGIoUPoly.forward()`

## Root Cause
The adaptive convex normalization feature uses registered buffers to track EMA state:
- `self._mgiou_ema` - EMA of MGIoU values
- `self._prev_pow` - Previous power value for smooth transitions

These buffers are initialized on CPU by default using `register_buffer()`. When the model is moved to CUDA and training begins:
1. Input tensors (`pred`, `target`) are on CUDA
2. Computed tensors (`mgiou`, `edge_scale`) are on CUDA  
3. But registered buffers (`_mgiou_ema`, `_prev_pow`) remain on CPU
4. Operations mixing CPU and CUDA tensors cause RuntimeError

## Fix

**File:** `ultralytics/utils/loss.py:498-527`

Added device synchronization at the start of the adaptive normalization block:

```python
# Adaptive convex normalization
if self.adaptive_convex_pow:
    with torch.no_grad():
        # Get device from input tensors
        device = target_valid.device
        
        # Update EMA on the correct device
        m = mgiou.mean().detach()
        self._mgiou_ema = self._mgiou_ema.to(device)
        self._prev_pow = self._prev_pow.to(device)
        self._mgiou_ema.mul_(self.ema_momentum).add_((1 - self.ema_momentum) * m)
        
        # ... rest of adaptive logic
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Get device from inputs:** `device = target_valid.device`
2. **Move buffers to correct device:** 
   - `self._mgiou_ema = self._mgiou_ema.to(device)`
   - `self._prev_pow = self._prev_pow.to(device)`
3. **Buffers stay on correct device:** Once moved to CUDA, they remain there for subsequent iterations

## Why This Works
- `register_buffer()` creates persistent state that moves with the model
- But initial values are created on CPU
- Explicit `.to(device)` ensures buffers match input tensor device
- First forward pass moves buffers to CUDA, subsequent passes find them already there
- All tensor operations now happen on the same device

## Verification

### Test 1: Device Consistency
```python
# test_device_fix.py
device = "cuda"
loss_fn = MGIoUPoly(reduction="mean", adaptive_convex_pow=True)
pred = torch.randn(4, 4, 2, device=device, requires_grad=True)
target = torch.randn(4, 4, 2, device=device)
weights = torch.ones(4, device=device)

loss = loss_fn(pred, target, weight=weights)  # ✓ Works!
loss.backward()  # ✓ Works!
```

**Result:** ✅ Both forward and backward passes succeed

### Test 2: PolygonLoss Integration
```python
loss_fn = PolygonLoss(use_mgiou=True)
pred = torch.randn(4, 4, 2, device='cuda', requires_grad=True)
target = torch.randn(4, 4, 2, device='cuda')
mask = torch.ones(4, 4, dtype=torch.bool, device='cuda')
area = torch.ones(4, 1, device='cuda') * 10.0

total_loss, mgiou_loss = loss_fn(pred, target, mask, area)  # ✓ Works!
total_loss.backward()  # ✓ Works!
```

**Result:** ✅ Full integration with PolygonLoss succeeds

### Test 3: Existing Test Suite
All existing tests continue to pass:
- ✅ `test_final_verification.py` - All 7 comprehensive tests pass
- ✅ `test_mgiou_integration.py` - All 10 integration tests pass
- ✅ `test_polygon_loss_issue.py` - Double-mean verification passes

## Impact
- **Fixes CUDA Training:** MGIoU-based polygon loss now works correctly on GPU
- **No Behavior Change:** Loss values and gradients unchanged for CPU training
- **Minimal Overhead:** `.to(device)` is a no-op after first iteration when already on correct device
- **Automatic:** Users don't need to manually manage buffer devices

## Alternative Approaches Considered

### 1. Register buffers on CUDA initially
```python
# ❌ Doesn't work - device unknown at init time
self.register_buffer("_mgiou_ema", torch.tensor(0.0, device='cuda'))
```
**Problem:** Model might be used on CPU, and device is unknown at initialization

### 2. Move buffers in model's `.to()` method
```python
# ❌ More complex, requires overriding .to()
def to(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super().to(*args, **kwargs)
    # manually move buffers...
```
**Problem:** `register_buffer()` should handle this automatically, and it does after our fix

### 3. Use `.cuda()` instead of `.to(device)`
```python
# ❌ Assumes CUDA, breaks CPU-only systems
self._mgiou_ema = self._mgiou_ema.cuda()
```
**Problem:** Not portable to CPU-only environments

### 4. Current approach: Lazy device synchronization ✅
```python
# ✓ Best: Sync to input device on first use
device = target_valid.device
self._mgiou_ema = self._mgiou_ema.to(device)
```
**Advantages:**
- Works for both CPU and CUDA
- Minimal overhead (no-op after first call)
- Uses standard PyTorch patterns
- Buffers automatically follow input tensors
