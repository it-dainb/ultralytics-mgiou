# Redundant `.mean()` Call Fix

## Summary
Removed redundant `.mean()` call in `PolygonLoss.forward()` method for code clarity.

## Issue
In `ultralytics/utils/loss.py` line 845, there was a redundant `.mean()` call:

```python
# Before
mgiou_losses = self.mgiou_loss(pred_poly, gt_poly, weight=weights)
total_loss = mgiou_losses.mean()  # ← Redundant!
```

## Root Cause
- `self.mgiou_loss` is initialized with `reduction="mean"` (line 812)
- `MGIoUPoly` with `reduction="mean"` already returns a scalar
- Calling `.mean()` on a scalar just returns the scalar itself
- While mathematically correct (no double-mean), it was confusing

## Fix
Simplified the code to make intent clear:

```python
# After (line 843-844)
# MGIoUPoly already returns scalar with reduction='mean', no need for additional .mean()
total_loss = self.mgiou_loss(pred_poly, gt_poly, weight=weights)
```

## Verification
All existing tests pass with no behavior change:

✅ `test_final_verification.py` - All 7 test suites pass
✅ `test_polygon_loss_issue.py` - Confirms no double-mean issue
✅ `test_mgiou_integration.py` - All 10 integration tests pass

## Impact
- **Code Clarity**: Eliminates confusion about whether double-mean is occurring
- **Maintainability**: Future developers won't question this redundant operation
- **Behavior**: No change - mathematically equivalent
- **Performance**: Trivial improvement (one less no-op call)
